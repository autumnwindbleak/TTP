# TTP
Packing Plan

The two approaches implemented in class Optimisation of our above-mentioned package randomly select or deselect an item. Try to outperform these two reference approaches. You can consider (simple/complex) local searches, problem-features such as certain ratios and distances, other evolutionary algorithms, purely mathematical approaches, . . .

- [x] For this exercise, you are only allowed to modify the packing plan, and you need to
use the TSP tours as provided in the folder instances of our package.

- [x] The time limit for each optimisation is 10 minutes, and multi-threading is not
allowed.
